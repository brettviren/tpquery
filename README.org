#+title: PTMP Services

This package provides clients and servers that work with [[https://github.com/brettviren/ptmp][PTMP]].

* Installation

Usual.

* Concepts

The trigger primitive queue (TPQ) provides ordered and random access
to recent sets of trigger primitives.  The TPQ server receives ~TPSet~
messages from a number of PTMP sources, buffers them indexed by their
~TPSet.detid~ and ~TPSet.tstart~ values, and provides them to clients on
request based on queries against these indices.  A ~detid~ match is
performed with a logical AND.  A ~tstart~ is matched to a resolution as
configured by the server.  A query may return zero, one or more ~TPSet~
messages.  The server keeps its input ~TPSet~ messages invariant.
